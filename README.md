# Math Project

This is one of my oldest projects that I've preserved.  
The goal was to create a functional calculator and math application.  
The math and algorithms can get quite complex and at times pushed the limits of my skills and understanding.  
Still, this is what I managed to buildâ€”not perfect, not bad, but reasonably solid.

## Features

* Intermediate-level mathematics
* Hierarchical engine for versatile calculations
* Wide variety of mathematical functions
* Matrix calculations
* Ability to declare variables and custom functions

## Try Math App

You can try it [here](https://pahkasoft.github.io/math-app/index.html).

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install --workspaces

# Run in watch mode:
npm run watch --workspace math-lib
npm run start --workspace math-app

# Build all workspaces for production:
npm run build:prod --workspaces
```
